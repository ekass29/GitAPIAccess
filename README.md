# GitHub Organization Access Report API

## Overview

This tool generates a comprehensive access report for a GitHub organization, mapping which users have access to which repositories and with what permissions. It provides a REST API endpoint that returns organization access data in a structured JSON format.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with scopes: `repo`, `read:org`
  - Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd GitAccessAPI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
   GITHUB_ORG=your_organization_name_here
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   You should see: `Server running on port 3000`

## How Authentication Works

Every GitHub API request includes a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

The token grants read access to organization and repository data. **Never commit the `.env` file to version control**—it contains sensitive credentials. The `.gitignore` file automatically excludes it.

## Running the Project

**Start the server:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Development mode** (auto-restart on file changes):
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Open the UI:**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the web interface
- Or use the API endpoints directly with curl/Postman

## Web Interface

The UI provides three main features:

### Load Full Report
Click **Load Full Report** to fetch the complete organization access data. Results show all repositories with their collaborators and a user map of permissions. The response includes:
- `generatedAt`: Timestamp of report generation
- `totalRepos`: Count of repositories analyzed
- `totalUsers`: Count of unique users
- `repoMap`: Repository-centric view of access
- `userMap`: User-centric view of repository access

### Clear Cache & Reload
Click **Clear Cache & Reload** to invalidate the in-memory cache and fetch fresh data from GitHub. Useful when organization access has recently changed and you need the latest information.

### Search User
Enter a GitHub username and click **Search User** to see all repositories that user has access to, along with their permission level (admin, write, or read). Shows "User not found" if the username doesn't exist in the organization.

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/report

Returns the complete organization access report with all repositories and user permissions.

**Query the API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/report
```

**Sample Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "generatedAt": "2026-03-23T10:30:45.123Z",
  "totalRepos": 42,
  "totalUsers": 15,
  "repoMap": {
    "frontend": {
      "repoName": "frontend",
      "fullName": "acme-corp/frontend",
      "private": true,
      "url": "https://github.com/acme-corp/frontend",
      "collaborators": [
        { "login": "alice", "role_name": "admin" },
        { "login": "bob", "role_name": "write" }
      ]
    },
    "backend": {
      "repoName": "backend",
      "fullName": "acme-corp/backend",
      "private": false,
      "url": "https://github.com/acme-corp/backend",
      "collaborators": [

      ]
    }
  },
  "userMap": {
    "alice": {
      "login": "alice",
      "repos": [
        { "repoName": "frontend", "role": "admin" },
        { "repoName": "backend", "role": "admin" }
      ]
    },
    "bob": {
      "login": "bob",
      "repos": [
        { "repoName": "frontend", "role": "write" }
      ]
    },
    "charlie": {
      "login": "charlie",
      "repos": [
        { "repoName": "backend", "role": "read" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- `generatedAt` - ISO 8601 timestamp of when report was generated
- `totalRepos` - Count of repositories analyzed
- `totalUsers` - Count of unique users with access
- `repoMap` - Object mapping repository names to their details and collaborators
- `userMap` - Object mapping usernames to their accessible repositories and roles
- `X-Cache` header - `HIT` if served from cache, `MISS` if freshly fetched

**Error Response (500):**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to fetch repositories for org your_org: GitHub API error"
}
```

### POST /api/cache/clear

Clears the in-memory cache and forces a fresh report generation on the next request.

**Query the API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cache/clear
```

**Sample Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Cache cleared successfully"
}
```

### GET /api/report/user/:username

Returns access details for a specific user (repositories and roles).

**Query the API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/report/user/alice
```

**Sample Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "login": "alice",
  "repos": [
    { "repoName": "frontend", "role": "admin" },
    { "repoName": "backend", "role": "admin" },
    { "repoName": "api", "role": "write" }
  ]
}
```

**When user not found (404):**
```json
{ "error": "User not found" }
```

## Design Decisions

### Batching Strategy (10 Repos at a Time)
Instead of fetching collaborators sequentially (slow) or all-in-parallel (rate limit explosion), the report generation processes repositories in batches of 10 using `Promise.all()`. Each batch waits for completion before starting the next. This balances speed with GitHub's rate limits: 60 requests per minute for authenticated users. Batching of 10 allows multiple batch cycles without hitting limits for organizations with hundreds of repos.

### In-Memory Caching with 5-Minute TTL
The `/api/report` endpoint caches results in memory with a 5-minute time-to-live (TTL). This minimizes repeated API calls for organizations that monitor access frequently. The cache is validated on each request: if still valid, results are served with `X-Cache: HIT`; if expired, a fresh report is generated and cached with `X-Cache: MISS`. Use the `POST /api/cache/clear` endpoint to manually invalidate the cache when needed.

### Using `affiliation=all` for Collaborators
The collaborators endpoint is called with `?affiliation=all` to capture:
- **Direct collaborators**: Users explicitly added to the repo
- **Team members**: Users with access through organization teams

This provides a complete picture of who has access. Without this parameter, you'd miss team-based access, which is common in organizations.

### Error Handling with Graceful Degradation
If a repository is inaccessible (e.g., 403 forbidden on private/restricted repos), the API returns an empty collaborators array rather than failing the entire report. This allows the report to complete successfully even if some repos cannot be accessed.

### Rate Limit Retry Logic
If GitHub returns a 429 (rate limit) response, the client automatically retries up to 3 times with 1-second delays between attempts. This prevents temporary rate limit issues from causing failures.

### Limitation: Nested Team Memberships
The API does not resolve nested team memberships. If a user is in "Team A" and "Team A" is a member of "Team B," the report shows access through "Team A" only, not the transitive "Team B" relationship. Full transitive team resolution would require additional GitHub API calls.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **HTTP Client**: node-fetch
- **Configuration**: dotenv
- **Middleware**: CORS (enables cross-origin requests)

## Example Usage

**Python client example:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://localhost:3000/api/report')
report = response.json()

for username, user_data in report['userMap'].items():
    print(f"{username}: {len(user_data['repos'])} repositories")
    for repo in user_data['repos']:
        print(f"  - {repo['repoName']} ({repo['role']})")
```

**cURL example:**
```bash
# Get full report
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/report | jq '.totalUsers'

# Pretty print with jq
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/report | jq '.'
```

## Scaling Notes

For organizations with 1000+ repositories:

- **Increases API calls**: Preparing reports will take longer on first generation
- **Rate limits matter**: GitHub enforces 60 requests/minute for authenticated users (300 for enterprise)
- **Retry logic helps**: Automatic retries prevent temporal failures
- **Batch processing essential**: Processing 10 repos at a time prevents overwhelming the API

For production deployments at scale, consider:
- Caching results with Redis
- Background job queues for report generation
- Webhook subscriptions for incremental updates
- Database storage for historical snapshots
```

The `X-Cache` header indicates whether data was served from cache (HIT) or freshly fetched (MISS).

## Scaling Notes

For organizations with 1000+ repositories and multi-server deployments, the following upgrades are now available or recommended:

### Already Implemented ✅
- **Redis Cache Support**: Optional Redis integration for cache persistence and horizontal scaling (see "Caching" section above)
- **Rate Limit Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on 429 responses with exponential backoff (up to 3 retries)
- **Request Logging**: All requests logged for monitoring and debugging
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite to verify API contracts

### Recommended for Further Scaling
- **Job Queue**: Use a background job system (Bull, RabbitMQ) to defer report generation and prevent blocking on large orgs
- **Webhooks**: Subscribe to GitHub organization events (member.added, repository.created, etc.) to update cache incrementally
- **Database**: Store historical snapshots to track access changes over time and enable audit trails
- **Pagination**: Implement cursor-based pagination in API responses to handle 50+ MB datasets
- **Async Report Generation**: Expose a job endpoint that returns a job ID, then allow polling for completion
- **CDN/Caching Proxy**: Nginx with caching in front of the API for geographic distribution
